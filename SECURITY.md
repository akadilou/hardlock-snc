# 🛡️ Security Policy — Hardlock-SNC

> Security is not a feature; it’s a property of the process.  
> This document describes the scope, guarantees, and enforcement controls applied to the Hardlock-SNC core.

---

## 🎯 Scope

This policy applies to all components of **Hardlock-SNC**:

- Rust crates: `hardlock_snc`, `ffi`, `hpke`, `ratchet`, `aead`, `token`
- FFI and SDK bindings: C / Dart / Android
- CI/CD pipelines enforcing build integrity (`guard-main`, `unsafe-gate`, `geiger-report`, `miri`, `coverage`, `sdks`)

All code within this scope must be **deterministically reproducible**, **formally reviewed**, and **free of undefined behavior (UB)**.

---

## ⚖️ Threat Model Anchors

| Domain | Guarantee | Enforcement |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Cryptography** | Constant-time, misuse-resistant, version-pinned algorithms | RustCrypto crates only; pinned semver |
| **Memory Safety** | No `unsafe` in application code; FFI boundary isolated | CI: `unsafe-gate`, `cargo geiger`, Miri |
| **Supply Chain** | All crates, actions, and tools hashed + verified | `cargo deny`, `guard-main`, signed commits |
| **Build Integrity** | Reproducible builds across CI | Deterministic flags in `Cargo.toml` + pinned toolchain |
| **Key Handling** | In-memory only; no filesystem persistence | Argon2id ephemeral KDF; zeroize buffers |
| **PQC Readiness** | Hybrid Kyber-768 handshake (opt-in) | Feature flag `hybrid-pqc` |
| **Transparency** | Signed STH + inclusion proofs | Verified during CI regression tests |

---

## 🧩 CI/CD Guardrails (Enforced)

1. **Lint pedantic** — `clippy::pedantic -D warnings`
2. **Unit tests** — `cargo test --locked`
3. **Supply chain audit** — `cargo deny check`
4. **Unsafe tracking** — `cargo geiger` JSON artifact (`unsafe` only allowed in `ffi.rs`)
5. **UB detection** — Miri on nightly across workspace (`miri.yml`)
6. **Coverage** — Tarpaulin Cobertura XML artifact (`coverage.yml`)
7. **Fuzzing** — `cargo fuzz` + ASan (non-blocking, artifacts uploaded)
8. **Branch protection** — Direct pushes to `main` forbidden; PR merges only
9. **SDK verification** — FFI signatures validated before publishing (`sdk-tests.yml`)

> All guardrails must be **green** for a commit to be eligible for release tagging.

---

## 🧱 Memory Safety Principles

- Zero `unsafe` except at FFI boundary (`src/ffi.rs`)
- All sensitive buffers (`key`, `nonce`, `salt`) are **zeroized** before drop
- Stack allocations preferred; heap allocations bounded
- No global mutable state
- Fuzz harnesses run with ASan, LSan, and MSan on Ubuntu
- `Miri` CI step enforces UB-free semantics on nightly

---

## 🔐 Key Management & Transparency

- **Key Transparency Log:**  
  Signed STH (Ed25519), inclusion proofs verified in CI regression.  
- **No Key Export:**  
  Private keys never serialized outside the process memory.
- **FFI ABI Stability:**  
  The generated C header `hardlock_snc.h` is versioned and archived as an artifact in each release.
- **Session Recovery:**  
  `hl_snc_session_save()` / `load()` perform authenticated export only; ciphertext integrity checked on import.

---

## 🧬 Supply Chain Integrity

- All dependencies verified via `cargo deny` (allowlist enforced)
- Toolchain pinned via `rust-toolchain.toml`
- GitHub Actions locked to `@v4` or commit-pinned
- Docker base images (`ubuntu-latest`) validated via digest
- Reproducibility checked with:
  ```bash
  cargo build --frozen --locked
  sha256sum target/release/libhardlock_snc.*

🧠 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability, please follow coordinated disclosure:
	•	Preferred contact:
📧 security@tufkey.io (PGP key fingerprint available upon request)
	•	Alternative:
Use GitHub Security Advisories tab → “Report a vulnerability”
	•	Expected SLA:
	•	Triage within 72h
	•	Patch proposal within 5 business days
	•	Public disclosure after mutual validation

Reports should include:
	1.	A proof-of-concept (PoC)
	2.	Affected component(s)
	3.	Expected vs actual behavior
	4.	Estimated impact (confidentiality, integrity, availability)

⸻

🧩 Vulnerability Handling Process
	1.	Issue assigned internal ID (HL-YYYY-XXXX)
	2.	Root-cause analysis documented in /SECURITY_REPORTS/
	3.	Fix validated under Miri, Clippy, Tarpaulin
	4.	CVE requested (if applicable)
	5.	Advisory published under advisories/ and GitHub Security tab

⸻
